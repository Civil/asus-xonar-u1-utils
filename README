Xonard: a simple daemon to handle the non standard audio controls on Asus Xonar U1 devices
Copyright 2012-2013 Alessandro Pignotti

Asus Xonar U1 are pretty nice USB audio devices with a decent audio quality and a knob to
control the volume and mute status of the device. The audio device itself is completely
supported by linux using the snd-usb-audio kernel module. The control interface identifies
itself as a standard HID devices, unfortunately this seems to be not actually true.

Xonard will configure the device to properly deliver interrupts when the knob is used
using the hidraw kernel interface and deliver the events to the system using the uinput
kernel interface. As an added bonus the blue LED blinking is set to something reasonable.

I've also reverse engineered how to configure the blinking of both the blue and red LEDs
and the code should be pretty self explanatory about how to use this functionality. But
this is not currently used beside setting a sane default
